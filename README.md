## 🎯 Why I Built It

I built Divine Notes to practice building a fully interactive React app while also creating something personally meaningful. The project helped me strengthen component structure, form handling, CRUD logic, memoized filtering, and data persistence — all wrapped inside a peaceful, minimalist interface.
